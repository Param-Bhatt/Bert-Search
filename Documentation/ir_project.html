                Using the knowledge gained from the classes, we made a domain specific search engine. We have
                implemented an Information Retrieval system to search for relevant emails from a dataset of Enron
                Corporation. Their emails were leaked into the public and it was reviled that they were a fraud
                organisation.<br> We chose this dataset as it had a lot of emails and they were generic and formal
                which gave us a well paved way to find a lot of words in our pretrained embeddings corpus.
            </li>

            <li>
              <h4>
                We used the concept of embeddings where each word is assigned in a multi-dimensional vector space. The
                vector corresponding for each word depicts it's semantic meaning. It is better at representing the
                meanings of the words than TF-IDF or any other classical method.

            <li>
              <h4>
                We used embeddings which were learned by deep learning models. The embeddings models are explained
                further. <br>
                <ul><br>
                  <li>
                    BERT :- Bi-Directional Encoder Representation from Transformers is a deep learning model that
                    focuses on attention to learn and understand embeddings. It has learned the embeddings in a 768-d
                    vector space.
                  </li><br>

                  <li>
                    GLOVE :- Global Vectors for Word Representation is a model for distributed word representations
                    learned from unsupervised learning where the distance between the embeddings of the words maps to
                    their semantic similarity. It comes in various dimensional spaces such as 50-d,100-d, etc. We have
                    used 300-d space which is the largest space given by GLOVE.

                We created a separate html file, describing our data structures and algorithm , our tests , and various
                problems that we faced during writing this tracer. We have also added what we have learned from it and
                the results obtained.

            issues that we had while doing it and what results we obtained from doing this project.
